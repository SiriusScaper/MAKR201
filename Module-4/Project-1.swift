We now know enough Swift to begin tackling some real-world problems. For this assignment, you are given a scenario in which you need to solve a problem with programming. You are told what you need to do, but not how to do it. This is how you will encounter problems if you become a programmer. It will test your ability to combine all of the things we have learned in these first two modules. You can submit your work by either copy and pasting code or uploading a Swift file.


Here it is:

You are hired by a teacher to automatically generate a report of test scores. The teacher will give you an array of scores and an array of names, with each name corresponding to a score of the same index. The teacher wants each name to be printed alongside the score of that person, like this:

Jack: 87

Jill: 93

Bill: 76

The teacher also wants to reach out to help all of the people that need to retake the test due to a low score. You need to generate a list of names (without scores) of all the people who scored 60 or lower. This list should also be printed to the console, with a title printed above it saying “Students to retake test”. As an example, it should look like this:

 

Students to retake test

Allen

Joy

Nico

 

Here are the arrays to use:

[60, 94, 78, 52, 21, 84, 73, 61, 99, 88]

[“Fitz”, “Beyonce”, “Jimi”, “Justin”, “Selena”, “Khalid”, “Jorja”, “Leila”, “Freddie”, “Bjork”]
